TODO's

A 1- Exception handling (can we handle any way other than printing error, ex. set to default value, prompt user to try again)
C 2- Get rid of playMusic function (refactor into where it's called)
D 3- Add card hierarchy explanation to rules
4- Move ChangeListener for spinnerDifficulty to GameController (like the EventListeners for buttons were)
A 5- Add the rest of ActionListeners (already created in GameController, just need changed in UI)
6- Connect barPlayerHealth to outcome of compareCards() (listener for GC)
7- Get rid of Wins/Losses move health bars / menu button
8- Create text that will be displayed at game start, and after each turn. (also where that will be held)
9- endPanel txtYouWin("You Win!") should be variable (String win or loss) not hardcoded
10- ImageIcon attribute added to the cards?
11- Create the card .jpg's and add to the images package, also add the ".src/..." paths to the deck text file and handle when card created
12- GameController needs to set button image when a new card is drawn from the deck into hand
13- Do we have a function that gets new card for hand after play?
14- Finish JUnit tests with at least one for compareCards(...) with branch coverage
15- Create a data package and move textfiles to that package
