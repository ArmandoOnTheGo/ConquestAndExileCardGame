---IN PROGRESS---
(A) Exception handling (can we handle any way other than printing error, ex. set to default value, prompt user to try again)
(D) Add card hierarchy explanation to rules
(D) Create the card .jpg's and add to the images package

---UNASSIGNED---
Connect barPlayerHealth to outcome of compareCards() (listener for GC)
Create text that will be displayed at game start, and after each turn. (also where that will be held)
GameController needs to set button image when a new card is drawn from the deck into hand
Create a data package and move textfiles to that package
