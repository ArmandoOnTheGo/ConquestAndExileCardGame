---IN PROGRESS---
(A) Exception handling (can we handle any way other than printing error, ex. set to default value, prompt user to try again)
(D) Add card hierarchy explanation to rules
(A) Add the rest of ActionListeners (already created in GameController, just need changed in UI)
(L) Finish JUnit tests with at least one for compareCards(...) with branch coverage
(D) Create the card .jpg's and add to the images package

---UNASSIGNED---
Connect barPlayerHealth to outcome of compareCards() (listener for GC)
Create text that will be displayed at game start, and after each turn. (also where that will be held)
endPanel txtYouWin("You Win!") should be variable (String win or loss) not hardcoded
GameController needs to set button image when a new card is drawn from the deck into hand
Do we have a function that gets new card for hand after play?
Create a data package and move textfiles to that package
Move ChangeListener for spinnerDifficulty to GameController (like the EventListeners for buttons were)
